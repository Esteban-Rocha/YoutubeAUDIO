![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sheddup/YoutubeAUDIO/master/icons/extensionLogo.png) : <b>YoutubeAUDIO</b> is a Firefox extension that enables you to listen to Youtube videos without video content being downloaded or processed.

Known issues:
- Embedded videos not supported(yet), embedded videos should play like normal
- Image overlay can clash with the add-on'Youtube High Definition' when the video size preference is set to 'full page', although this appears to not be a problem at all with the new youtube layout
- You need an adblocker otherwise video ads break the extension(looking into a fix)

Unknown issues:
- None so far! Submit an issue ticket so I can find out about the issue
